    """Representation of Dataverse dataset in a remote instance.

    Apart from providing an API for basic operations on such a dataset,
    a main purpose of this class is the uniform and consistent mangling
    of local DataLad datasets path to the corresponding counterparts
    on Dataverse. Dataverse imposing strict limits to acceptably names
    for `directoryLabel` and `label`. So strict, that it rules out anything
    not representable by a subset of ASCII, and therefore any non-latin
    alphabet. See the documentation of the ``mangle_path()`` function
    for details.

    If ``root_path`` is set, then all paths in the scope of the Dataverse
    dataset will be prefixed with this path. This establishes an alternative
    root path for all dataset operations. It will not be possible to upload,
    download, rename (etc) files from outside this prefix scope, or across
    scopes.

    On initialization only a record of what is in the latest version (draft or
    not) of the dataverse dataset is retrieved, including an annotation of
    content on whether it is released. This annotation is crucial, since it has
    implications on what to record should changes be uploaded.  For
    example: It is not possible to actually remove content from a released
    version.

    This record is later maintained locally when changes are made without ever
    requesting a full update again. In case of checking the presence of a file
    that does not appear to be part of the latest version, a request for such a
    record on all known dataverse dataset versions is made.
